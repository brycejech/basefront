# basefront

Base files for starting a front-end project. Also includes basefront.css, a minimalistic CSS microframework, which contains a 12-column grid, some basic resets, typography, utility classes, and basic form styles.

Goal here is *minimalism*, a la skeleton.css, combined with the power and flexibility of SASS, and a simple, though *slightly* more featured grid system. Oh, and no margin-based gutters!
